The real remedy is to destroy the belief in the sanctity of the shastras. How do you expect to succeed if you allow the shastras to continue to be
held as sacred and infallible? You must take a stand against the scriptures. Either you must stop the practice of caste or you must stop believing
in the shastras. You cannot have both. The problem of caste is not a problem of social reform. It is a problem of overthrowing the authority of the
shastras. So long as people believe in the sanctity of the shastras, they will never be able to get rid of caste. The work of social reform is like the
work of a gardener who is constantly pruning the leaves and branches of a tree without ever attacking the roots. The real enemy is the belief in the
shastras
